## Team 04-front (MultiTravel)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project is a website where any person can make a travel plan considering multiple destinations and different routes to each one (Air travel, maritime travel or land travel). Also the website will suggest you some of the best lodging in every destination. In the website you can see an offer of destinations that you can add into your plan and confirm the reservation and then see your active reservations and finished travels in your profile.


## Deployment

In order to get the project runnning, clone the Back repository found in [Team04-back](https://github.com/isis3710-uniandes/Team04-back) under the release tag: Entrega3_Back.

Once cloned, execute cmd in the repository folder and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev-start
```
You should see the following message:

```bash
app running on port 3001
```
Now, clone this repository and run the following commands inside the folder:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

After a couple of seconds, a browser tab should be deployed running "localhost:3000" and you should be able to see and interact with the website.
